                    We talked about reporting in the section above but we needed three items here, so mentioning it one more
                    time
                    for posterity.

                    We don’t offer this as part of our software but that statement is inarguably true. Accurate inventory
                    tracking would help you for sure.

                    This also isn’t actually a feature, it’s just some friendly advice. We definitely recommend that you do
